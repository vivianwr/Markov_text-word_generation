# Markov_text-word_generation
Generate text/word by predicting from the former text/words.
1. Generate Random Text
Create several Markov classes to generate text that use characters that follow other characters to predict the next possible character. The more characters we use in the prediction, the more likely the text will appear like the training text.
2. Add Java Interface
Organize the program in a different way, using an interface and an abstract class.
Utility and Flexibility;
Open-Closed Software Design;
Efficient by using HashMap;
3. Generate Random Words
Similar thing as random text but by using words instead of characters.
